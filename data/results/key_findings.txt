1. CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PARADOX
   - CoT prompting DECREASES performance by 53-74%
   - Likely due to error propagation in reasoning chains
   - Implication: More reasoning ≠ better answers

2. VULNERABILITY TO CONTRADICTIONS
   - Contradictory context causes 74% performance drop (most severe)
   - 53% of failures are "contradiction blindness"
   - Models fail to detect conflicting information

3. BELIEF PERSISTENCE
   - Without context:  78.7% adopt suggested wrong answers
   - With context: 24.7% adopt wrong answers (3x better)
   - Factual context provides crucial anchoring

4. FALSEHOOD RESILIENCE (Surprising)
   - Injected falsehoods had minimal impact (0.1% drop)
   - Model appears to ignore obviously false statements
   - May rely more on parametric knowledge than context

5. SELF-VERIFICATION:  MIXED RESULTS
   - Context-based verification:  +19.7% improvement (EFFECTIVE)
   - Simple "Are you sure?" verification: -10.1% (HARMFUL)
   - Generic verification can cause second-guessing of correct answers
   - Targeted context re-reading is the only effective strategy

6. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Avoid CoT prompting for factual QA tasks
   - Always provide factual context to reduce belief persistence
   - Use context-based verification, not generic "are you sure?" prompts
   - Be cautious of contradictory information in retrieved contexts
